# 🚧 plugOS — Under Construction 🚧

> **Status:** Work in Progress  
> Expect breaking changes, missing features, and a few curious penguins 🐧

## 📌 About

**plugOS** is a **plugin-based Linux operating system** designed for maximum modularity and minimalism.  
Instead of installing a full-blown system with everything baked in, plugOS lets you start with a **bare-minimum OS** and **add only the features or applications you need** — as plugins.  

Think of it as **"Linux, à la carte"** 🍽️  

We’re currently building the foundation — things will be unstable, incomplete, and rapidly evolving.

## 🛠 Current Status

- [ ] Project scaffolding set up  
- [ ] Core architecture draft  
- [ ] Plugin management system  
- [ ] Base OS image build  
- [ ] Plugin registry (store/repo)  
- [ ] Documentation and developer guides  
- [ ] First public beta release

## 🧩 Core Idea

plugOS starts minimal — just the kernel, a shell, and a package manager.  
Then you build your perfect environment piece by piece:

```bash
plug install desktop:gnome
plug install browser:firefox
plug install devtools:python
```

No unnecessary services. No bundled software you don’t need.
Just a clean, fast, and truly modular Linux experience.

## ⚙️ Getting Started

> ⚠️ plugOS is in early development and not ready for daily use yet.

## Clone and explore locally:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/imsudiproy/plugOS.git
cd plugOS
```
> ⚠️ (Build and installation instructions will be added as the project evolves.)
